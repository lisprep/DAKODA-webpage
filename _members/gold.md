As an academic researcher in image processing, I combine the image processing with computational linguistics to investigate the possibilities and limitations of automatic handwriting recognition in educational settings for learners and, in particular, improve image preprocessing using artificial intelligence.

#### Research Interests

- Handwriting Recognition (HWR) of Learners 
- Preprocessing steps for HWR
- ML in general

#### Short Vita
- From April 2022: Research assistant at professorship "Computational Linguistic" at the Research Cluster D²L² (Digitalization, Diversity and Lifelong Learning), FernUniversität in Hagen
- 02.2019 - 04.2022: Researcher at Language Technology Lab, Universität Duisburg-Essen
