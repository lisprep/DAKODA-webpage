    abstract = "In this paper we present a browser plugin \textit{NewsScan} that assists online news readers in evaluating the quality of online content they read by providing \textit{information nutrition labels} for online news articles. In analogy to groceries, where nutrition labels help consumers make choices that they consider best for themselves, information nutrition labels tag online news articles with data that help readers judge the articles they engage with. This paper discusses the choice of the labels, their implementation and visualization.",

 abstract = {NLP applications for learners often rely on annotated learner corpora. Thereby,    it is important that the annotations are both meaningful for the task, and    consistent and reliable. We present a new longitudinal L1 learner corpus for    German (handwritten texts collected in grade 2--4), which is transcribed and    annotated with a target hypothesis that strictly only corrects orthographic    errors, and is thereby tailored to research and tool development for    orthographic issues in primary school. While for most corpora, transcription    and target hypothesis are not evaluated, we conducted a detailed    inter-annotator agreement study for both tasks. Although we achieved high    agreement, our discussion of cases of disagreement shows that even with    detailed guidelines, annotators differ here and there for different reasons,    which should also be considered when working with transcriptions and target    hypotheses of other corpora, especially if no explicit guidelines for their construction are known.},

 abstract = {Compared to early language development, later changes to the language system during orthography and literacy acquisition have not yet been researched in detail. We present a longitudinal corpus of texts on short picture stories written by German primary school children between grades 2 and 4 and grades 3 and 4. It includes 1,922 texts with 212,505 tokens (6,364 types) from 251 children. For each text, rich metadata is available, including age, grade and linguistic background (at least 60{\%} of the children were multilingual). To our knowledge, our corpus is the largest longitudinal corpus of written texts by children at primary school age. Each word is included in its original spelling as well as in a normalized form (target hypothesis), specifying the intended word form, which we corrected for orthographic but not grammatical errors. Original and target word forms are aligned character-wise and the target word forms are enriched with phonological, syllabic, and morphological information. Additionally, for each target word form, we established key lexical variables, e.g., word frequency or summed bigram frequency, as specified in childLex. Where applicable, we also specify key features of German orthography (e.g., consonant doubling, vowel-lengthening {\textless}h{\textgreater}). Taken together, this information allows for a detailed assessment of the properties of words that tend to increase the likelihood of spelling errors. The corpus is available in different formats-as tab-delimited annotated token and type based lists, in an XML format, and via the corpus search tool ANNIS.},

    abstract = "To date, corpus and computational linguistic work on written language acquisition has mostly dealt with second language learners who have usually already mastered orthography acquisition in their first language. In this paper, we present the Litkey Corpus, a richly-annotated longitudinal corpus of written texts produced by primary school children in Germany from grades 2 to 4. The paper focuses on the (semi-)automatic annotation procedure at various linguistic levels, which include POS tags, features of the word-internal structure (phonemes, syllables, morphemes) and key orthographic features of the target words as well as a categorization of spelling errors. Comprehensive evaluations show that high accuracy was achieved on all levels, making the Litkey Corpus a useful resource for corpus-based research on literacy acquisition of German primary school children and for developing NLP tools for educational purposes. The corpus is freely available under https://www.linguistics.rub.de/litkeycorpus/.",
