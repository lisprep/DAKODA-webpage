We build our system on top of a state-of-the-art system for binary hateful meme classification that already uses image tags such as race, gender, and web entities. We add further metadata such as emotions and experiment with data augmentation techniques, as hateful instances are underrepresented in the data set.",

abstract = "Social media plays a great role in news dissemination which includes good and bad news. However, studies show that news, in general, has a significant impact on our mental stature and that this influence is more in bad news. An ideal situation would be that we have a tool that can help to filter out the type of news we do not want to consume. In this paper, we provide the basis for such a tool. In our work, we focus on Twitter. We release a manually annotated dataset containing 6,853 tweets from 5 different topical categories. Each tweet is annotated with good and bad labels. We also investigate various machine learning systems and features and evaluate their performance on the newly generated dataset. We also perform a comparative analysis with sentiments showing that sentiment alone is not enough to distinguish between good and bad news.",

News from social media is potentially useful for various stakeholders including aid organizations, news agencies, and individuals. However, social media also contains a vast amount of non-news content. For users to be able to draw on benefits from news reported on social media it is necessary to reliably identify news content and differentiate it from non-news. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of classifying a social post as news or not. To this end, we provide a new manually annotated dataset containing 2,992 tweets from 5 different topical categories. Unlike earlier datasets, it includes postings posted by personal users who do not promote a business or a product and are not affiliated with any organization. We also investigate various baseline systems and evaluate their performance on the newly generated dataset. Our results show that the best classifiers are the SVM and BERT models.",

abstract = {Implementations of word sense disambiguation (WSD) algorithms tend to be tied to a particular test corpus format and sense inventory. This makes it difficult to test their performance on new data sets, or to compare them against past algorithms implemented for different data sets. In this paper we present DKPro WSD, a freely licensed, general-purpose framework for WSD which is both modular and extensible. DKPro WSD abstracts the WSD process in such a way that test corpora, sense inventories, and algorithms can be freely swapped. Its UIMA-based architecture makes it easy to add support for new resources and algorithms. Related tasks such as word sense induction and entity linking are also supported.},

To discover targets, we use a measure of semantic relatedness between texts. We nd that semantic relatedness is useful to identify targets for ambiguous link anchors. In collections that contain no existing links, using only document titles as anchor candidates can be enhanced by using arbitrary noun phrases extracted from documents.},

We create two new datasets to evaluate our approaches for hierarchy identification. We find that our algorithm performs on a level that is sufficient for a fully automated system. For documents without given segment titles, we extend out work by auto matically generating segment titles.

On the basis of detailed analysis of newly collected data, we develop a model for C-test difficulty introducing four dimensions: solution difficulty, candidate ambiguity, inter-gap dependency, and paragraph difficulty. We show that cues from all four dimensions contribute to C-test difficulty.},

In a more realistic setting with fewer training data, the text-based approach yields better results.},

We provide an analysis of the important parameters of ESA using datasets in five different languages. Additionally, we propose the use of ESA with multiple lexical semantic resources thus exploiting multiple evidence of term cooccurrence to improve over the Wikipedia-based measure. Exploiting the improved robustness and coverage of the proposed combination, we report improved performance over single resources in word semantic relatedness, solving word choice problems, classification of semantic relations between nominals, and text similarity.},
